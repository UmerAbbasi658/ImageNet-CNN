# ImageNet-CNN
In this notebook i have used 4 CNN Architecture 
1- LeNet Architecture
2-AlexNet Architecture
3-VGG Arcitecture
4-Google Net Architecture
These show that the more we increase the Convolutional Layers the more model will perform well and in this different data sets were used for processing that were also used in ImageNet Competitions but due to large data sets i have used less number of epochs but if you will use large number of epochs it will surely increase the performance of your network.
